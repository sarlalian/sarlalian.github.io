## History of a blog

Over the years I’ve maintained various blog’s using various
engines, including [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/),
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and
[Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/home), and most recently my move to
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).  Hugo, like Jekyll is a simple blog aware
static website engine.  With the larger, more comprehensive platforms,
I always felt trapped and constrained within whatever themes were
available, but with the static site generators it was easier to iterate
on the design to get the look and effect that I wanted.


## Ruby vs. Go

I enjoy [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) as a programming language,
I use it a bit at my [DayJob](http://www.laika.com), and when my blog
was using Jekyll or Octopress which is based on Jekyll, that was the
language of choice there as well.  Ruby is a beautiful, expressive
language that lends its self, much like perl to clever code.  I guess
that over the years, I have grown less fond of eing clever with my code.
So this incarnation around, I decided to go with hugo.  It is written in
[Go](https://golang.org/) which I am growing increasingly fond of.  I
came across [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) because it was created by [Steve
Francia](http://spf13.com/) who created several packages that I use in my
go development.  So far I’m liking it quite a lot.


## Hugo

Hugo seems to have the full gambit of features that one would look for
in a static site generator.

* [Themes](http://gohugo.io/themes/overview/)
* [Front matter](http://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/)
* [Sections](http://gohugo.io/content/sections/)
* [Templates](http://gohugo.io/templates/overview/)
* [Live Reload](http://gohugo.io/extras/livereload/)
* [Syntax Highlighting](http://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/)
* [And more...](http://gohugo.io/extras/aliases/)

Also, since hugo is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), it will work
on most unixes as well as windows, and deployment is as simple as 
downloading a single binary.  Oh and did I mention, its fast.  Damn fast,
really really damn fast.  So far, I’m liking it quite a lot.
